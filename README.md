# <p align="center"> Blockchain in Oil and gas </p>
  <p align="center"> How has the utlization of blockchain replacing traditional ledgers and contracts effected the oil and gas industry? </p>
  
## Basis
I've been hired by a small oil company to see the benefits of integrating blockchain into the company software replacing their ledger and use of contracts to see if they should utilize this "new" technology.

We created collected and cleaned the data laying out the benefits of implementing blockchain.

## Data

I've collected and cleaned the data from multiple sources specifically their financial reports. I have cleaned all the data into a single .csv file.

**Data Included**
| Years  | Type of Data  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|2017-Present |Amount of Oil Produced |
| 2017-Present |  Revenue  |
| 2017-Present | Profit  |
| 2017-Present | Expense |

**Potential Data Issues**

* Since the technology is so new, a majority of oil companies begain using the blockchain technology in 2019 and politics due to a change in president meaning new regulations. This results in only focusing on the year 2019-2020.
